## Resources to Start Learning about Generative AI

Here are some resources to help you start learning about generative AI:

- [Generative AI Models: A Complete Guide](https://www.eweek.com/artificial-intelligence/generative-ai-model/) - Learn how generative AI models work and how they can be used for various applications.
- [Introduction to Generative AI](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/536) - This is an introductory level microlearning course aimed at explaining what Generative AI is, how it is used, and how it differs from traditional machine learning methods. It also covers Google Tools to help you develop your own Gen AI apps.

### Popular Language Models (LLMs)

Language models have revolutionized the field of natural language processing and artificial intelligence. Here are some of the most prominent models available:

- [GPT-3/3.5/4, etc.](https://openai.com/product) - These models are known for their advanced text generation capabilities, with GPT-4 being a multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) that powers tools like ChatGPT.
- [OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex) - Also from OpenAI, Codex specializes in generating and autocompleting code based on natural language prompts. It's the foundation for GitHub Copilot.
- [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/) - Created by Stability AI, Stable Diffusion is a widely recognized text-to-image diffusion model, known for its ability to generate high-quality images from textual descriptions.
- [VertexAI](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-studio?hl=en) - Vertex AI provides APIs for leading foundation models, and tools to rapidly prototype, easily tune models with your own data, and seamlessly deploy to applications.
- [PaLM](https://ai.google/discover/palm2/) - Google's PaLM, including its latest iteration PaLM 2, is a transformer-based LLM focused on multilingual content generation and coding. It serves as the foundation for Google Bard.
- [AlphaCode](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/competitive-programming-with-alphacode/) - From DeepMind, AlphaCode is a large language model that assists in coding by generating code snippets and solutions based on natural language inputs.
- [BLOOM](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom) - Developed by Hugging Face, BLOOM is a multilingual autoregressive LLM, adept at completing text and code with missing segments.
- [LLaMA](https://ai.meta.com/llama/) - Meta's LLaMA is designed to be a more accessible generative AI model, catering to users with limited infrastructural resources.
- [Midjourney](https://path-to-midjourney) - Operating similarly to Stable Diffusion, Midjourney is a generative AI model that produces imagery from natural language prompts.
- [MistralAI](https://huggingface.co/mistralai) - Mixtral is a powerful and fast model adaptable to many use-cases. While being 6x faster, it matches or outperform Llama 2 70B on all benchmarks, speaks many languages, has natural coding abilities.

Each of these models has unique features and applications, ranging from text generation to code automation and image creation, significantly contributing to the advancement of AI and machine learning.

## Cohere

[Cohere](https://cohere.ai/) is a platform that provides a wide range of pre-trained models and tools for natural language processing (NLP) and generative AI. It is known for its user-friendly interface, extensive model library, and active community support. Here are some reasons why you should try Cohere:

- Easy access to state-of-the-art NLP models.
- Simplified implementation of generative AI algorithms.
- Collaborative platform for sharing and exploring models.
